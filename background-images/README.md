# Background Images
Highly-optimized, precision-crafted background images for four different spaces.

... Whatever, they're just stupid color-coded .pngs.

## The usual setup
Color-coded workspaces help me mentally compartmentalize spaces. Here are my usual spaces themes:

### Space #1, _Terminal and Hacking_
Space one is colored *orange*. Apps include:
- Terminal
- Atom / Code editor
- Git GUI

### Space #2, _Browsing and Chat_
Space two is colored *blue*. Apps include:
- Browser / Developer tools pane
- Chat windows

### Space #3, _Administrative Stuff_
Space three is colored *green*. Apps include:
- Mail
- Calendar
- Finder windows
- Settings
- Activity Monitor
- Text files

### Space #4, _Design_
Space four is *grayscale*. Apps include:
- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Font book
- Digital Color Meter
