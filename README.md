# mac-setup
This is a collection of scripts and stuff I use for my personal OSX setup. Feel free to use. Here's a summary of each tool:

###21-day-bin
Instructions and a shell script for creating a folder that auto-deletes files in it that are older than 21 days. Useful for storing screenshots and temp files.

###background-images
My personal color-coded background images. Four of them; one per each workspace.

###copy-filename-as-repo-url
This lets you right-click on an image file in Finder, and automatically copy it to your clipboard as it would appear in a URL for an image in my repo. Useful as a kind of personalized “Get Dropbox URL”.

###screenshot-downscaling
Adds a shortcut for screenshotting: Saves the original size, and a half-size, to a folder on the desktop. Useful because retina-sized-screenshots are way too big.
